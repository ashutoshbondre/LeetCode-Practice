/*
1.The key task here is to connect those emails, and this is a perfect use case for union find.
2.to group these emails, each group need to have a representative, or parent.
3.At the beginning, set each email as its own representative.
4.Emails in each account naturally belong to a same group, and should be joined by assigning to the same parent (letâ€™s use the parent of first email in that list)
